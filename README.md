# Decision_region_and_loss_fun

In this file I am going to present two examples.
In Example 1, I have compare the two decision plots (one is obtained from scikit-learn coefficients after fitting the model and the second
plot is obtained by setting the coefficents manually) and have investigated how the decision boundary is changed by the coefficients.

In second example, I have computing the loss function on the Boston housing data set and compare the result with the results of built-in 
module.

# importand module for this excercise

2. LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model 
3. matplotlib.pyplot
